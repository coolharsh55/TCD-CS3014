                Selecting Algorithms
            </h2>
            <p>
            You must explain the reason why you selected a particular algorithm.
            <br/>
            You can either choose an algorithm to demonstrate that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    it is NOT parallelisable in an efficient way

                    <strong>
                        or,
                    </strong>
                    you can improve its performance by parallelising it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Both approaches must be proved using code and performance metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
            Algorithms must be run on
            <code>

                <li>
                    Your code must be readable. Non-readable code will not be acceptable.

                    Your code must be compilable. Non-compilable code will not be acceptable. Your code must have comments describing how it should be compiled.
